# Python_app_Freedom_of_Information

With widespread COVID-19 and adapting "new normal" during the pandemic, managing a large volume of "Freedom of Information" work became a new challenge for public authorities. This difficulty includes deciding how to allocate resources and prioritise tasks to support public transparency and safeguard the right to access information. To help with this, a software named "Freedom of Information" was designed to support the public to extract requested information and visualisation. This software is developed to provide information and visualisations about Stop and Search Statistics and COVID-19 cases integrated into one application. It is a tool to provide reliable and meaningful visualisation to the public and speed up the current requests process.

This software contains two key programmings to graphically represent the information about Stop and Search data by the Police and COVID-19 Confirmed Cases. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed to make it more user friendly to interact. The first program's data was retrieved from the public API provided detailed Stop and searches related information reported by an individual police force. The second program data includes COVID-19 daily number of cases by individual five-year age groups and aggregated by age into 0-59, 60 plus. The software is written in Python by Visual Studio Code with the support of several open-source libraries for data processing, analysis, and visualisation
